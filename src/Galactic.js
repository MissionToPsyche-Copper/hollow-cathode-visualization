export const heatTitleText = "Heat Inserts"
export const heatText = " Heaters are coiled around the cathode tube and are responsible for heating up the cathode insert to extreme temperatures, at least at 1200 degrees Celsius (or 2192 degrees Fahrenheit). Heaters are surrounded by a heat shield to trap heat in and protect other electrical components from the extreme heat generated by the heat inserts. The insert is made of special material which can emit electrons at high temperatures. The insert is placed inside of the hollow cathode and pushed against the orifice.";

export const gasTitleText2 = "Gas Feed"
export const gasText = " The role of the gas feed is to inject Xenon gas into the cathode tube. Xenon is a neutral or noble gas, meaning it doesnâ€™t react to electric or magnetic fields, but when Xenon atom collides and gain electrons, it becomes a negatively charged particle. This process is called ionization. Since Xenon becomes a negatively charged particle, it can be attracted by positive voltage or magnetic field.";

Therefore, the role of the keeper electrode is to pull the internal plasma out of the cathode tube.";

The purpose of the external plasma is to pull positively charged plasma generated by the Hall thruster as well as is used to neutralize the spacecraft to prevent it from being charged.";
